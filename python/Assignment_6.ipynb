This helps others (including yourself in the future) understand the code without the need for excessive comments.\n","\n","2. **Use lowercase letters**: Variable names should be in all lowercase letters, separated by underscores, if necessary. For example: `num_students`, `average_score`, `max_value`.\n","\n","3. **Avoid single-character names**: Unless the variable represents an iteration variable (e.g., `i` for loops), avoid using single-character names like `x`, `y`, or `z`. Instead, use descriptive names even for short-lived variables.\n","\n","4. **Be concise but not cryptic**: Keep variable names reasonably short while still being descriptive. Avoid using abbreviations that may be unclear to others.\n","\n","5. **Use nouns for object names**: Variables typically represent objects, so using nouns is more appropriate. For instance, use `customer_name` rather than `get_name()`.\n","\n","6. **Use underscores for readability**: To improve readability, separate words in variable names using underscores. This is often referred to as \"snake_case.\"\n","\n","7. **Constants in uppercase**: If you have constants, their names should be written in uppercase letters. If a constant name consists of multiple words, use underscores to separate them. For example: `MAX_SIZE`, `PI_VALUE`.\n","\n","8. **Avoid using built-in names**: Don't use names of built-in functions or modules (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `file`, `str`, etc.) as variable names, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and confusion."],"metadata":{"id":"fBRGjSRW5OX6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q.4.
